# Front-end task

Build a shopping cart that has the following functionality using this dummy API `http://beta.json-generator.com/api/json/get/4kiDK7gxZ`

1. Show a grid of items with each item has price, thumbnail & "add to cart" button.
2. clicking one item should show more info about the item (description, price, remaining stock & add to cart button)
3. When you click the add to cart button the item should be added to the cart and the stock number should be updated in the detail view of the item.
4. The cart should have a checkout button, when clicked show a successful message and clear the cart.
5. Design is left for you, it's not a design task so nothing fancy but of course responsive. But functionality is more important.

Please provide a `README` file describing your rational, tools & ideas you used and why. Use git (github, gitlab or bitbucket repo) if possible, but if you can't provide a git repo somewhere make sure you send a zip file with the `.git` folder included.

If you have any questions, ideas or improvements to the task please don't hesitate to contact us.

Have fun and good luck!
