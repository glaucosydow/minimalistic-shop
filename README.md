# Minimalistic Shop

This project is a shopping cart [code challenge](BRIEFING.md). It uses React
components and Redux for data storage and manipulation. The project is [deployed
on GitHub Pages](http://jcemer.com/minimalistic-shop/).

It differs from [Redux Shopping Cart
Example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/shopping-cart)
by keeping a complete data structure for the cart. That approach reduces the
complexity and also turns the project more close to a real on-line store.
